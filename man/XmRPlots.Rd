\title{A function to create individual (X) and moving range (mR) control charts for QC metrics}
\usage{
XmRPlots(data, peptide, L = 1, U = 5, metric, normalization = FALSE,
  ytitle = "Individual Observations", type = "mean", selectMean = NULL,
  selectSD = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Comma-separated (*.csv), QC metric file. It should contain a "Precursor" column and the "QC metrics" columns.
It can also include "Annotations" for each observation.}

\item{peptide}{The name of precursor you want to draw the plot for.}

\item{L}{Lower bound of the guide set.}

\item{U}{Upper bound of the guide set.}

\item{metric}{The name of the QC metric. For example it can be "BestRetentionTime"}

\item{normalization}{TRUE if data is standardized.}

\item{ytitle}{The y-axis name of the plot. It can be either "individual observations" or "moving ranges".
The x-axis title is by default "QCno-name of peptide".}

\item{type}{It can take two values, "mean" or "dispersion".}

\item{selectMean}{It is the mean of the metric. If you don't know the mean, select NULL}

\item{selectSD}{It is the standard deviation of the metric. If you don't know the mean, select NULL}
}
\description{
This function allows you to calculate X and mR statistics and draw control charts for certain QC metrics and peptides.
