# Introduction 

Targeted liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is a powerful tool for detection and quantification of peptides in complex matrices. An important objective of targeted LC-MS is to obtain peptide quantifications that are (1) suitable for the purpose of the investigation, and (2) reproducible across laboratories and runs.  The first objective is achieved by system suitability tests (SST), which verify that mass spectrometric instrumentation performs as specified. The second objective is achieved by quality control (QC), which provides in-process quality assurance of the sample profile. A common aspect of SST and QC is the longitudinal nature of their data. Although SST and QC receive a lot of attention in the proteomic community, the currently used statistical methods are fairly limited.

`MSstatsQC` improves upon the existing statistical methodology for SST and QC. It translates the modern methods of longitudinal statistical process control, such as simultaneous and time weighted control charts and change point analysis to the context of LC-MS experiments The methods are implemented in an open-source R-based software package and its web-based graphical user interface (www.msstats.org/msstatsqc), and are available for use stand-alone, or for integration with automated pipelines. Example dataset was generated during CPTAC Study 9.1 at Site 54. Although the example focus on targeted proteomics, the statistical methods more generally apply.

This vignette summarizes various aspects of all functionalities in `MSstatsQC` package and Shiny interface. 

# Input

In order to analyze QC/SST data in `MSstatsQC`, input data must be a .csv file in a "long" format with related columns. This is a common data format that can be generated from spectral processing tools such as Skyline.

This file can be also uploaded through Shiny interface. If the user prefers the web-interface then `Upload file` option should be used and a csv file which includes QC metrics and peptide level data should be uploaded. The recommended format includes `Acquired Time`, `Peptide name`, `Annotations` and data for any QC metrics such as `Retention Time`, `Total Peak Area` and `Mass Accuracy` etc. 

(a) `AcquiredTime`: This column shows the acquired time of the QC/SST sample in the format of MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS AM/PM

(b) `Precursor`: This column shows information about Precursor id. Statistical analysis will be done separately for each unique label in this column. 

(c) `Annotations`: Annotations are free-text information given by the analyst about each run. They can be informative explanations of any special cause or any observations related to a particular run. Annotations are carried in the plots provided by `MSstatsQC` interactively.  

(d)-(f) `RetentionTime`, `TotalPeakArea`, `FWHM`, `MassAccuracy`, and `PeakAssymetry`, and other metrics: These columns define a *feature* of a peak for a specific peptide. 

The example dataset is shown below. Each row corresponds to a single time point. Additionally, other inputs such as predefined limits or guide sets are discussed in further steps.

### Example

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
CPTAC_Study9.1_Site54 <- read.csv('/Users/sarataheri/GitHub/msstats-qc/Datasets/Sampledata_CPTAC_Study_9_1_Site54.csv', header=TRUE) 
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#A typical multi peptide and multi metric system suitability dataset
#This dataset was generated during CPTAC Study 9.1 at Site 54
# This a Comma-separated (*.csv), QC file format
S9Site54 <- CPTAC_Study9.1_Site54
```

# `MSstatsQC` functions 

`MSstatsQC` provides several core functions for state-of-the art statistical process control methods that are not available in other software. Three main functions for monitoring are: `XmRPlots()`,`CUSUMPlots` and `ChangePointEstimator` functions. All of these core functions have the same architecture and they share the same arguments. In general, we will call these three functions as `APlotFunction` and we will later give details for each function. Now, we introduce the arguments for `APlotFunction`.

### Arguments

* `data`: comma-separated (.csv), metric file. It should contain a "Precursor" column and the metrics columns. It should also include "Annotations" for each observation.
* `peptide`: the name of precursor of interest.
* `L`: lower bound of the guide set.
* `U`: upper bound of the guide set.
* `metric`: the name of metric of interest.
* `normalization`: TRUE if data is standardized.
* `ytitle`: the y-axis title of the plot. The x-axis title is by default "Time : name of peptide"
* `type`: the type of the control chart. Two values can be assigned, "mean" or "dispersion". Default is "mean"
* `selectMean`: the mean of a metric. It is used when mean is known. It is NULL when mean is not known.  The default is NULL.
* `selectSD`: the standard deviation of a metric. It is used when standard deviation is known. It is NULL when mean is not known. The default is NULL.

### Example

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#A general MSstatsQC plot function when a guide set (1-20 runs) is used to monitor the mean of a metric
APlotFunction( S9Site54, peptide, L = 1, U = 5, metric, normalization = FALSE,
                      ytitle = "A Plot", type = "mean", selectMean = NULL, selectSD = NULL )
```

`MSstatsQC` processes data and creates plots with core functions. However, multi metric and multi peptide cases are difficult to assess. Therefore, we introduce several summary functions that aggregate the conclusions from each metric over all the analytes and summaries obtained for a core function method. `RadarPlots()` and `RiverPlots` are `MSstatsQC` summary functions. In general, we will call these two functions as `ASummaryFunction` and we will later give details for each function. Now, we introduce the arguments for `ASummaryFunction`.

### Arguments

* `data`: comma-separated (.csv), metric file. It should contain a "Precursor" column and the metrics columns. It should also include "Annotations" for each observation.
* `peptide`: the name of precursor of interest.
* `L`: lower bound of the guide set.
* `U`: upper bound of the guide set.
* `listMean`: list of the means for each metric. It is used when mean is known. It is NULL when mean is not known.  The default is NULL.
* `listSD`: list of the standard deviations for each metric. It is used when standard deviation is known. It is NULL when mean is not known. The default is NULL.

### Example

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#A general MSstatsQC summary function when a guide set (1-5 runs) is used 
ASummaryFunction( S9Site54, L = 1, U = 5, listMean = NULL, listSD = NULL )
```

# Output

Plots created by the core plot functions are generate by `plotly` which is an R package for interactive plot generation. The interactive plots created by `MSstatsQC`, can be saved as an html file using the save widget function. If the user wants to save a static png file, then `export` function can be used. The outputs of other MSstatsQC functions are generated by `ggplot2` package and saving those outputs would require using `ggsave` function.

### Example

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Saving plots generated by plotly
p<-APlotFunction(S9Site54, peptide="a peptide", metric="a metric")
htmlwidgets::saveWidget(p, "Aplot.html")
export(p, file = "Aplot.png")

#Saving plots generated by ggplot2
p<-ASummaryFunction(S9Site54, L=1, U=5)
ggsave(filename="Summary.pdf", plot=p)
#or
ggsave(filename="Summary.png", plot=p)
```

### Tip for Shiny users: 

Each output generated by 'plotly' can be saved using the "plotly" toolset located in the corner of each plot.

# Data processing

Data is checked with `DataProcess()` function to ensure data sanity and efficiently use core and summary `MSstatsQC` funtions. `MSstatsQC` uses a data validation method where slight variations in column names are compansated and converted to the standard `MSstatsQC` format. For example, our data validation function converts column names like `Best.RT`, `best retention time`, `retention time`, `rt` and `best ret` into `BestRetentionTime`. This conversion also deals with case-sensitive typing. 

### Arguments

* `data` : comma-separated (.csv), metric file. It should contain a "Precursor" column and the metrics columns. It should also include "Annotations" for each observation.

### Example

```{r, eval=FALSE}
DataProcess(S9Site54)
```

### Tip for Shiny users: 

"Data import" tab automatically checks data and validate it for further use. 

# Setting options

## Chosing metrics

Metrics (e.g. retention time and peak area) and peptides are chosen within all core functions with 'metric' argument. MSstatsQC can handle any metrics of interest. User needs to create data columns just after `Annotations` to import metrics into `MSstatsQC` successfully. 

### Example

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Defining metric of interest within APlotFunction
APlotFunction(S9Site54, "LVNELTEFAK", metric = "TotalArea")
APlotFunction(S9Site54, "LVNELTEFAK", metric = "RetentionTime")
```

## Defining mean and variability of a metric

#### Setting predefined limits 

Predefined limits are commonly used in system sutiability studies. If the mean and variability of a metric is well known, they can be defined using 'selectMean' and 'selectSD' arguments in core plot functions (e.g. XmRplots function). For example, if mean of retention time is 34.5 minutes, standard deviation is 1 minutes and X chart is used for peptide LVNELTEFAK, we use XmRplot function as follows.

### Example

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Mean and standard deviation of LVNELTEFAK is known
APlotFunction(data, "LVNELTEFAK", metric = "RetentionTime", selectMean = 34.5, selectSD = 1 )
```

Similarly, if the mean and standard deviation is known, summary functions uses `listMean` and `listSD` arguments. For example, if user monitors retention time and peak assymetry and mean and standard deviations of these metrics are known, arguments will require entering a vector for means and another vector for standard deviations. 

### Example

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Retention time >> mean is 34.5 and standard deviation is 1.0
# Peak assymetry >> mean is 1.0  and standard deviation is 0.01
ASummaryFunction(data, listMean=list("Retention time” = 34.5, “Peak asymmetry” = 1.0), listSD = list("Retention time” = 1, “Peak asymmetry” = 0.01))
```

#### Choosing a guide set 

The true values of mean and variability of a metric is typically unknown, and their estimates are obtained from a guide set of high quality runs. Generally, a data gathering and parameter estimation step is required. Within that phase, control limits are obtained to test the hypothesis of statistical control. These thresholds are selected to ensure a specified type I error probability (e.g. 0.0027). Constructing control charts and real time evaluation are considered after achieving this phase. Guide sets are defined with 'L' and 'U' arguments. For example, if retention time of a peptide is monitored and first 20 observations of the dataset are used as a guide set, a plot is constructed as follows. 

### Example

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Guide set is chosen as the first 20 observations of dataset
APlotFunction(data, "peptide", metric = "QC metric", L=1, U=20) 
```

Guide sets are also required for summary functions when the mean and standard deviation of a metric is not known.

### Example

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Guide set is chosen as the first 20 observations of dataset
ASummaryFunction(data, L=1, U=20) 
```

### Tip for Shiny users: 

"Options" tab is used to set metrics and peptides of interest. Guide set and known mean and standard deviation are also set within "Options" tab.Select a proper and representative guide set using `Options` tab. The lower bound of guide set indicates the index of the first time point to be included in the guide set. For example, if you choose "1" as a lower bound, it means that first time point will be the first element of the guide set. Similarly, upper bound of guide set shows the index for the last observation. It is possible to use different guide sets for different metrics and peptides.

# `MSstatsQC` functions: control charts

These fuctions are used to generate individual (X) and moving range (mR), and cumulative sum for mean (CUSUMm) and cumulative sum for variability (CUSUMv) control charts for each metric. X and mR charts are constructed using `XmRPlots()` function. For example, if user constructs an X control chart of retention time for LVNELTEFAK and retention time mean and standard deviations are present, the function is used as follows.

### Example: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Retention time >> mean is 34.5 and standard deviation is 1.0
XmRPlots(S9Site54, "LVNELTEFAK", metric = "RetentionTime", type="mean", selectMean = 34.5, selectSD = 1)
```

If user constructs an X control chart of retention time and peak area for LVNELTEFAK and means and standard deviations are not known, the function is used as follows. 

### Example: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Retention time >> first 20 observations are used as a guide set
XmRPlots(S9Site54, "LVNELTEFAK", metric = "RetentionTime", type="mean", L = 1, U = 20)
XmRPlots(S9Site54, "LVNELTEFAK", metric = "TotalPeakArea", type="mean", L = 1, U = 20)
```

If user constructs an mR control chart of retention time and peak area for LVNELTEFAK and mean and standard deviations are not known, the function is used as follows. 

### Example: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Retention time >> first 20 observations are used as a guide set
XmRPlots(S9Site54, "LVNELTEFAK", metric = "RetentionTime", type="dispersion", L = 1, U = 20)
XmRPlots(S9Site54, "LVNELTEFAK", metric = "TotalPeakArea", type="dispersion", L = 1, U = 20)
```

Similarly, if user constructs a CUSUMm or a CUSUMv control chart of retention time and peak area for LVNELTEFAK and mean and standard deviations are not known, `CUSUMPlots` function is used as follows. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Retention time >> first 20 observations are used as a guide set
CUSUMPlots(S9Site54, "LVNELTEFAK", metric = "RetentionTime", type="mean", L=1, U=20, ytitle="CUSUMm")
CUSUMPlots(S9Site54, "LVNELTEFAK", metric = "TotalPeakArea", type="mean", L=1, U=20, ytitle="CUSUMm")
CUSUMPlots(S9Site54, "LVNELTEFAK", metric = "RetentionTime", type="dispersion", L=1, U=20, ytitle="CUSUMv")
CUSUMPlots(S9Site54, "LVNELTEFAK", metric = "TotalPeakArea", type="dispersion", L=1, U=20, ytitle="CUSUMv")
```

### Tip for Shiny users:

"Control charts" tab is used to construct X and mR and CUSUMm and CUSUMv control charts.
